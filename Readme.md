# Byte-pair encoding algorithm
- In computing, byte-pair encoding is an algorithm, first described in 1994 by Philip Gage, for encoding strings of text into smaller strings by creating and using a translation table. A slightly modified version of the algorithm is used in large language model tokenizers.
